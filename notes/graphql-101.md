## What is GraphQL?

GraphQL is short for Graph Query Language. Instead of the server determining what data to send back to the client, the client decides with a query.

## Why use GraphQL?

1. GraphQL is fast
    - Can reduce multiple round trips to the server and fewer db calls.
2. GraphQL is flexible
    - A mobile app doesn't need to endpoints. It can request a different set of data that is fit for a slower network or smaller screen.
3. GraphQL is easy to use and simple to maintain
    - No need to version the api. The client can simply change its query.
